# GHSearch Platform

This project is made of two subprojects:
1. `application`: The main application has two main responsibilities:
    1. Crawling GitHub and retrieving repository information. This can be disabled with `app.crawl.enabled` argument.
    2. Serving as the backend server for website/frontend
2. `front-end`: A frontend for searching the database, which is available at http://seart-ghs.si.usi.ch

## FAQ

### How can I report a bug or request a feature or ask a question?**
Please add a [new issue](https://github.com/seart-group/ghs/issues/) and we will get back to you very soon.

### How add a new programming language to platform?
Add the new **language name** to `supported_languages` table via:

1. Flyway migration file (recommended): Create a new file `src/main/resources/db/migration/Vx__NewLangs.sql` containing:
   `INSERT INTO supported_language (name,added) VALUES ('C++',current_timestamp);`
2. Or, manually editing the table.

- **Note**: 
  - A comprehensive list of valid languages (and their aliases) are available at [here](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml). 
  - Plus you can see a similar list at [GitHub Advanced Search Page](https://github.com/search/advanced). 
  - You can use the following link to verify if a language is valid, and gives an upper-bound for the number of new repositories to be mined:
    - Example: `C++` -> `C%2B%2B`:`https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=is:public+stars:%3E10+language:C%2B%2B`.
